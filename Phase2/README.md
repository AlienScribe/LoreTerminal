# Phase 2 â€“ Vite / GraphQL

This phase provides a richer development environment using Vite for the client and an Express server with a GraphQL endpoint.

## Setup

```bash
cd Phase2
npm install
```

### Development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will start on port `3000` by default and proxies API requests to the local Express server.

### Running tests

```bash
npm test
```

Jest is configured for basic unit tests under `test/`.
