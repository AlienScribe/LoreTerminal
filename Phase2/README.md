# A-01 Canon Terminal

This phase contains the modern implementation of the A-01 Canon Terminal. It uses Vite and modern JavaScript to deliver an interactive lore exploration experience.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run the test suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

The application serves `index.html` which loads the terminal UI. Styles live in `public/styles.css` and scripts are in `src/`.
