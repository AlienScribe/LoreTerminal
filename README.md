# LoreTerminal

This repository contains two development phases of the "Retro Futurist CRT" terminal for exploring Alien Worlds lore.

- **Phase1** – A static Express server serving files from `Public/`. Useful for quick prototypes.
- **Phase2** – A modern Vite + Express setup with a GraphQL API, sample React front‑end code and Jest tests.

For more details on running each phase, see the README inside the respective folder.
