# LoreTerminal

The original prototype and the modern Vite/Express build have been consolidated into a single application located in **Phase2**.  Phase1 remains for historical reference, but all functionality is now included in the Phase2 codebase.

## Running the unified project

```bash
cd Phase2
npm install
npm run dev
```

To run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

## Recent additions

- Local bookmarking and comment threads for lore sections
