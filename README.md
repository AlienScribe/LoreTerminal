# Lore Terminal

This project aims to build a retro styled in‑browser terminal for viewing and interacting with Alien Worlds lore.

Features include:

- Aggregating canon and proposed lore via API calls
- Filtering, searching and bookmarking of lore entries
- Voting system for in‑progress lore proposals
- Markdown rendering with a pixel‑grid sci‑fi theme

Open `index.html` in a browser to try the minimal prototype.
