# Lore Terminal

Retro-inspired web terminal for browsing Alien Worlds lore. All canon lore is pulled directly from the project README on GitHub, while proposed lore entries are fetched from open pull requests.

## Development Setup
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run a local web server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

No automated tests are included. The interface is static and ready for deployment on any static hosting provider.
